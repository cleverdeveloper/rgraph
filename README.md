rgraph
======

This is the last MIT licensed version of RGraph chart library that could have been found on "http://www.rgraph.net/" website. The site was discontinued by the author according to https://twitter.com/_RGraph, so I decided to put it here in case someone wants to make a fork and maintain it. Be aware that there is a later version in existence, which had the commercial license, do not use it unless you know what are you doing.
